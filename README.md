# IE440 Fall19 - Final Exam Take-Home Question

This is the first question of final exam of IE440 Nonlinear Models in Operations Research lesson. The topic of the homework is **Neural networks** implementation.

The assignment has two different parts:
*	**Part 1:** We are interested in clustering a sample data using **K-means, Vector quantization** and **Self-organizing map (SOM)** algorithms with Neural networks.
*	**Part 2:** We are interested in solving the **Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP)** for cities of Turkey: first finding the exact solution with a solver, and then using **TSP-SOM** algorithm with **Gaussian Kernel** and **Elastic Band** neighborhood functions. **Gurobi solver** is used in the exact solution part.

Description file is available at [Description.pdf](Description.pdf). Data files are available under [Data](Data/) folder. Jupyter notebook of solution is available at [Source.ipynb](Source.ipynb) and Python file (py) is available at [Source.py](Source.py). The source code for Gurobi solver is [tsp_gurobi.py](tsp_gurobi.py) (it's written in Python 2.7). The solution of solver is [solver_solution.csv](solver_solution.csv) file.
